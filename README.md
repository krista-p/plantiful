# plantiful

plantiful is a mobile React Native application in which you can keep track of when you need to water your house plants! You can even give your plants a name!
Created and ran by Colin Bellamy, this application is has a beautiful and minimalistic UX/UI and serves a great purpose for a mobile app.

As a part of our senior portion at Codeworks, we were tasked with improving plantiful's codebase in any way that we found fitting.

In a team of 2 developers, May and I decided to refactor Colin's code into Typescript to make his code base more robust.

I was tasked with refactoring the backend code, and May was tasked with refactoring the frontend. Since the backend had less code, I was able to help with a few components on the front end.
